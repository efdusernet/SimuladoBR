Rolling wave planning – locking the entire project baseline in advance and using predictive methods to monitor execution
Explicação

The description in the original question “locking the entire project baseline in advance and using predictive methods to monitor execution” actually reflects a predictive or waterfall planning approach, not Rolling Wave Planning.
Explicação geral

Gold plating - Incorrect
This means adding features beyond the agreed scope, which is not happening here.

Scope creep - Incorrect
Scope creep occurs when changes happen without proper control. In your case, the changes are planned and managed.

Rolling wave planning - Close, but not the best answer
This technique involves planning near-term work in detail and future work at a higher level, and is often used within progressive elaboration.
However, the scenario describes a broader, ongoing refinement of scope, design, and constraints not just staged schedule planning, so progressive elaboration is the more accurate term.

122 You are managing a government-sponsored project that requires the development of a highly specialized cybersecurity software tool. Due to strict budget limitations and public accountability, minimizing financial risk for the buyer is critical. The scope is well-defined, and the technical specifications are documented in detail. As the project manager, which type of contract is most appropriate to minimize cost overrun risk for the buyer?
Resposta correta

*Fixed-price contract
Explicação
A fixed-price contract is the most appropriate choice to minimize cost overrun risk for the buyer in this scenario. In a fixed-price contract, the buyer agrees to pay a set price for the project, regardless of the actual costs incurred by the seller. This type of contract shifts the financial risk of cost overruns from the buyer to the seller, providing a high level of cost certainty for the buyer.

Time and materials contract
Explicação
A time and materials contract may not be the best option to minimize cost overrun risk for the buyer in this situation. In a time and materials contract, the buyer pays for the actual time and materials used by the seller, which can lead to cost overruns if the project takes longer or requires more resources than initially estimated. This type of contract does not provide the same level of cost certainty as a fixed-price contract.

Cost Plus Fixed-Fee
Explicação
A Cost Plus Fixed-Fee contract may not be the most appropriate choice to minimize cost overrun risk for the buyer in this case. In a Cost Plus Fixed-Fee contract, the buyer pays the actual costs incurred by the seller plus a fixed fee. This type of contract does not provide the same level of cost certainty as a fixed-price contract, as the buyer is still responsible for covering any cost overruns.
Sua resposta está incorreta

Cost Plus Incentive-Fee
Explicação
A Cost Plus Incentive-Fee contract may not be the best option to minimize cost overrun risk for the buyer in this scenario. In a Cost Plus Incentive-Fee contract, the buyer pays the actual costs incurred by the seller plus an incentive fee based on performance. While this type of contract can incentivize the seller to control costs, it does not provide the same level of cost certainty as a fixed-price contract, as the buyer may still be exposed to cost overruns.

133 You are managing a hybrid project that combines both traditional and agile approaches. The team is working on a new bus live tracking system for a transportation company. As part of the onboarding process for new team members, they need to understand the key aspects of the project, including the integration of real-time data, software development, and customer support. However, there have been issues with the accuracy of live tracking data, and new team members are struggling to grasp the hybrid approach to resolving the issue effectively.

As the project manager, how would you onboard the new team members to ensure they understand the project and can effectively contribute to solving the bus live tracking issue?
Sua resposta está incorreta

Provide detailed documentation outlining the traditional project methods for integration and software development, and instruct the team to follow it strictly, with little room for adaptation
Explicação
Providing detailed documentation outlining only the traditional project methods may not be sufficient for new team members to understand the hybrid approach and effectively contribute to solving the live tracking issue. Strict adherence to traditional methods without room for adaptation may hinder the team's ability to address the issue effectively.
Resposta correta

*Hold an onboarding session that explains both the agile and traditional methods used in the project, emphasizing collaboration and adaptability to address the live tracking issue
Explicação
Holding a hybrid onboarding session that explains both agile and traditional methods used in the project is the most effective approach to ensure new team members understand the project and can contribute to solving the live tracking issue. Emphasizing collaboration and adaptability will help the team navigate the hybrid approach and address the accuracy issues effectively.

Focus only on the agile methods, encouraging the team to adapt to frequent changes and ignore the traditional methods, since agile is the preferred approach for problem-solving
Explicação
Focusing only on agile methods and ignoring traditional methods may limit the team's understanding of the project's hybrid approach. While agile is valuable for problem-solving, a comprehensive understanding of both agile and traditional methods is necessary to address the live tracking issue effectively.

Give the team minimal training and let them learn on the job, assuming they will pick up the necessary knowledge and skills as they go along
Explicação
Giving the team minimal training and expecting them to learn on the job may result in a lack of understanding of the project's key aspects and the hybrid approach. This approach may lead to inefficiencies in addressing the live tracking issue and hinder the team's ability to contribute effectively.

134 You are managing an agile team working on a telecom project to set up new infrastructure across a large area. The project is facing cost overruns due to unexpected equipment expenses and vendor delays. As the project manager, you aim to use agile principles to control costs while maintaining team morale and meeting project goals. What is the most effective way to control project costs in this scenario?

Implementing Earned Value Management (EVM) techniques
Explicação
Implementing Earned Value Management (EVM) techniques can be beneficial for tracking project performance and cost variances. However, it may not be the most effective way to control costs in this scenario as it focuses more on monitoring and analyzing project performance rather than actively managing and optimizing costs.

Focus solely on cutting costs by reducing team hours, minimizing scope, and avoiding changes to keep within the fixed budget
Explicação
Focusing solely on cutting costs by reducing team hours, minimizing scope, and avoiding changes may lead to compromising the project quality, team morale, and stakeholder satisfaction. This approach may not be sustainable in the long run and could negatively impact the project's success.
Resposta correta

*Collaborate continuously with the team to identify opportunities for cost optimization, prioritize high-value features, and adjust based on regular feedback from stakeholders
Explicação
Collaborating continuously with the team to identify opportunities for cost optimization, prioritize high-value features, and adjust based on regular feedback from stakeholders aligns with agile principles. This approach promotes transparency, flexibility, and adaptability, allowing the team to make informed decisions to control costs while maintaining project goals and team morale.

Ignore the budget constraints and let the team work freely on the tasks without constantly monitoring costs, assuming the costs will stabilize as the project progresses
Explicação
Ignoring budget constraints and letting the team work freely without monitoring costs can lead to further cost overruns and project delays. It is essential to actively manage and control costs throughout the project lifecycle to ensure financial stability and project success.

135 You are managing an agile team working on an ice cream company’s new marketing campaign. The design team is struggling to come up with creative social media ad concepts under tight deadlines. As the project manager, you decide to adopt servant leadership to help the team. How should you approach this situation?

Take control of the design process and provide a pre-made concept for the team to execute to ensure the deadline is met
Explicação
Taking control of the design process and providing a pre-made concept may help meet the deadline, but it goes against the principles of servant leadership. Servant leadership focuses on supporting and empowering team members rather than dictating solutions to them.

Direct the team to focus on completing their tasks quickly, even if it means sacrificing creativity, to ensure the deadline is met
Explicação
Directing the team to focus on completing tasks quickly, even at the expense of creativity, is not in line with servant leadership principles. Servant leaders prioritize the well-being and growth of team members, encouraging them to do their best work rather than rushing through tasks.
Resposta correta

*Support the team by removing obstacles, offering encouragement, and facilitating a brainstorming session to help them generate creative ideas
Explicação
Supporting the team by removing obstacles, offering encouragement, and facilitating a brainstorming session aligns with servant leadership principles. By providing support and creating a collaborative environment, the project manager can help the team generate creative ideas and overcome challenges.

Give the team full responsibility for solving the problem but remove all deadlines to avoid putting pressure on them
Explicação
Giving the team full responsibility for solving the problem while removing deadlines may alleviate pressure, but it may also lead to a lack of urgency and accountability. Servant leadership involves providing guidance and support while empowering team members to take ownership of their work and meet deadlines effectively.

They feel their skills are not being used effectively due to new technologies being adopted by the team. How would you address this issue to re-engage the developer?
Resposta correta

*Offer the developer a chance to lead a new feature that aligns with their expertise, and provide training in the new technologies
Explicação
Offering the developer a chance to lead a new feature that aligns with their expertise and providing training in the new technologies can help re-engage the developer by leveraging their skills and knowledge. This approach shows that their expertise is valued and provides an opportunity for growth and development within the team.

Tell the developer to adapt to the new technologies or leave the team, as the project needs quick results
Explicação
Telling the developer to adapt to the new technologies or leave the team may further disengage the developer and create a negative work environment. This approach does not address the underlying issue of the developer feeling their skills are not being utilized effectively and may lead to increased disengagement.
Sua resposta está incorreta

Give the developer more challenging tasks
Explicação
Giving the developer more challenging tasks without addressing the root cause of their disengagement may not effectively re-engage the developer. While challenging tasks can be motivating, it is important to first understand and address the reasons behind the disengagement to ensure long-term engagement and productivity.

Ignore the situation, assuming the developer will adjust eventually
Explicação
Ignoring the situation and assuming the developer will adjust eventually is not a proactive approach to addressing the issue of disengagement. Ignoring the problem may lead to further disengagement and negatively impact team morale and productivity. It is important to address the issue directly and work towards finding a solution that re-engages the developer.

The team is highly collaborative and works in agile sprints to source candidates, conduct interviews, and place candidates in roles. Recently, one of the recruiters has demonstrated a strong emotional response after receiving feedback from a client about a candidate they submitted, which was not positively received. This feedback has caused the recruiter to feel personally responsible for the situation, leading to a decrease in confidence.

As the project manager, how would you handle this situation, using emotional intelligence, to help the recruiter regain their confidence while maintaining team productivity?

Offer to reassign the recruiter’s tasks temporarily so they can recover from the situation, believing that taking them off the active work will allow them to reset and return to a positive mindset
Explicação
Reassigning tasks may not address the underlying emotional response and could potentially make the recruiter feel isolated or undervalued. It is essential to address the emotional impact directly and provide support to help the recruiter regain confidence.
Sua resposta está incorreta

Set a team-wide policy that negative client feedback should be ignored, and focus on rewarding the team for positive feedback only, to avoid emotional setbacks
Explicação
Ignoring negative feedback and focusing only on positive feedback may create a culture of avoidance and hinder the team's ability to learn and improve. It is crucial to address and learn from both positive and negative feedback to foster growth and development.

Praise the recruiter for their efforts in sourcing candidates and ignore the feedback to help them move past the situation quickly, ensuring no further discussion of the issue
Explicação
Praising the recruiter and ignoring the feedback may invalidate their feelings and not provide a constructive way to address the situation. It is essential to acknowledge and address the emotional response to help the recruiter move forward positively.
Resposta correta

*Have a private, empathetic conversation with the recruiter, acknowledging their feelings, exploring how they perceive the feedback, and coaching them on reframing the situation as a learning opportunity to grow and improve
Explicação
Having a private, empathetic conversation with the recruiter, acknowledging their feelings, and coaching them on reframing the situation can help the recruiter regain confidence and see the feedback as an opportunity for growth. This approach promotes emotional intelligence and supports the recruiter's professional development.

Sua resposta está incorreta

Assign the departing employee’s tasks to an external resource or new hire immediately, without any team input, as agile prioritizes delivering value over team discussions and concerns
Explicação
Assigning tasks to an external resource or new hire without team input goes against agile principles of self-organizing teams and collaboration. It is essential to involve the team in decision-making processes to maintain a sense of ownership and accountability, which are crucial for team motivation and project success.

Redistribute the tasks among the team as needed, since agile values speed and direct action over any non-urgent team discussions

One of your team members has repeatedly failed to complete a mandatory course that is critical for maintaining company standards. Despite several reminders and follow-ups, the employee has not taken the necessary steps to complete the course citing tight project deadlines. After discussing the situation with HR and team leadership, you are now faced with the difficult decision of potentially terminating the employee. How would you handle this situation in line with agile principles while maintaining team morale and project momentum?

Temporarily move the employee to a different team, where they can “fail fast” and learn from their mistakes, as agile encourages iteration and adaptation
Explicação
Moving the employee to a different team may not address the root cause of the issue and could potentially disrupt the new team's dynamics. While agile encourages iteration and adaptation, it is important to address the employee's non-compliance with company standards directly.

Terminate the employee immediately to maintain the velocity of the team, as agile prioritizes the delivery of working software over individual compliance with company policies
Explicação
Terminating the employee immediately goes against the agile principle of valuing individuals and interactions over processes and tools. It is essential to explore other options before considering termination, as agile emphasizes collaboration and respect within the team.
Sua resposta está incorreta

Allow the team to self-organize and decide whether to remove the employee from the project, as agile emphasizes the power of the team in decision-making and accountability
Explicação
Allowing the team to self-organize and make the decision to remove the employee may lead to conflicts within the team and could impact team morale. While agile values team empowerment, it is important for the project manager to take a proactive role in addressing performance issues.

146 You’re leading a volunteer-based Agile team organizing recurring beach clean-up events. Over the past two iterations, a few volunteers have stopped showing up without any notice. One team member even said, “It’s just volunteer work where nobody’s getting paid.” Meanwhile, a few dedicated members are frustrated and feel like the group is drifting away from its original purpose. As the team lead, what should you do?

Respect that Agile values individual choice, and let each volunteer define their own level of engagement based on availability
Explicação
While Agile values individual choice and self-organization, it is important to ensure that all team members are aligned with the team's goals and commitments. Allowing volunteers to define their own level of engagement without any accountability may lead to inconsistency and lack of commitment, which can affect the team's effectiveness in achieving its objectives.

Set clearer participation rules and remind everyone during the next planning session that commitment is key to delivering outcomes
Explicação
Setting clearer participation rules and emphasizing the importance of commitment during planning sessions is a good practice. However, simply reminding volunteers about the importance of commitment may not address the underlying issues of lack of engagement and accountability within the team.
Resposta correta

*Realign the group by revisiting the shared purpose and invite an open conversation around what contribution and accountability mean in this context
Explicação
Realigning the group by revisiting the shared purpose and facilitating an open conversation around contribution and accountability is crucial in this situation. By engaging in a dialogue with the team members, you can address concerns, clarify expectations, and realign everyone towards the common goal of the beach clean-up events.

Track individual attendance trends over upcoming events and use that data to guide future team composition and planning
Explicação
While tracking individual attendance trends can provide valuable data for future planning, solely relying on attendance data to guide team composition and planning may not address the root cause of the issue.

147 You’re leading an agile team on a new AI-based analytics platform for a telecom client. Leadership is using Earned Value Management to track progress across all projects, including yours. During a sync-up, a stakeholder questions your team’s performance after seeing a low CPI (Cost Performance Index), even though the team is delivering value steadily and customer feedback is positive. Team morale dips, with several members questioning whether Agile is really “working” on this project. As the project lead, what should you do?

Share the CPI metric with the team and encourage them to accelerate velocity to improve future EVM scores
Explicação
Sharing the CPI metric with the team and encouraging them to accelerate velocity may not be the most effective approach as it could create unnecessary pressure on the team and potentially lead to burnout. It is important to consider the Agile principles of sustainable pace and continuous improvement rather than solely focusing on EVM scores.
Resposta correta

*Explain that EVM metrics don't fully reflect Agile value delivery and work with stakeholders to reframe expectations and success indicators
Explicação

This option reflects emotional intelligence, stakeholder management, and Agile mindset. It recognizes that traditional metrics like EVM don’t always align with Agile delivery models, especially early in projects. It defends the team, reframes success, and helps bridge Agile thinking with stakeholder expectations

Ask the Product Owner to reprioritize features to focus on low-effort, high-value items and boost EVM performance quickly
Explicação
Asking the Product Owner to reprioritize features to focus on low-effort, high-value items solely to boost EVM performance quickly may compromise the integrity of the Agile process. It is essential to prioritize value delivery to the customer over EVM metrics and to maintain the Agile principles of collaboration and responding to change.

Use the retrospective to highlight the gap in EVM performance and push the team to reflect on efficiency
Explicação
Using the retrospective to highlight the gap in EVM performance and pushing the team to reflect on efficiency may create a negative atmosphere within the team and undermine the trust and collaboration that are essential in Agile practices. It is important to focus on continuous improvement and learning from experiences rather than placing blame on team members for EVM scores.

Respect their autonomy and acknowledge that completing work early aligns with Agile's focus on working software over exhaustive processes
Explicação
While completing work early is valuable in Agile, it is important to remember that Agile values collaboration and teamwork. By not engaging in peer reviews, backlog refinement, or assisting the team, the senior developer may be missing out on opportunities for improvement and growth within the team dynamic.

Encourage them to pick up unassigned backlog items to maintain momentum and prevent idle time
Explicação

Resposta correta

*Give the analyst space and raise the issue in the retrospective to discuss system resilience
Explicação
Giving the analyst space after a major mistake allows them to recover and regain confidence. Bringing up the issue in the retrospective provides a safe environment to discuss what happened, identify root causes, and come up with solutions to prevent similar incidents in the future, such as improving system resilience.

Promote transparency by posting a team message about the error, and follow up with the analyst during the next sprint event
Explicação
Promoting transparency is important, but publicly addressing the error may not be the best approach as it could further shake the analyst's confidence. Following up with the analyst privately during the next sprint event allows for a more constructive discussion and support.

Emphasize performance in the next sprint planning and remind the team to double-check demos
Explicação
Emphasizing performance and reminding the team to double-check demos in the next sprint planning may address the symptom of the issue but does not address the underlying cause. Focusing solely on performance without understanding the root cause may not lead to effective improvement.

186 In a government-funded defense project developing a next-gen missile guidance system, a serious conflict arises between the lead software and hardware engineers. The software team requests a delay due to new compliance updates, while the hardware team insists on adhering to the original integration schedule due to external testing commitments. The tension grows, affecting team dynamics and delaying decisions. What is the most effective first step the project manager should take to address the conflict and protect project outcomes?

Reduce project scope to ease pressure and avoid further disagreement between the teams.
Explicação
Reducing project scope may temporarily ease pressure, but it does not address the underlying conflict between the software and hardware teams. It may also lead to further disagreements and compromise the project's objectives and outcomes.
Sua resposta está incorreta

Reassign one of the engineers to a non-critical module to remove the source of conflict
Explicação
Reassigning one of the engineers to a non-critical module may alleviate the immediate tension, but it does not address the root cause of the conflict between the software and hardware teams. It may also create resentment and impact team morale and productivity.

Escalate the issue immediately to senior management or the government project sponsor
Explicação
Escalating the issue to senior management or the government project sponsor should be a last resort after all other options have been exhausted. It may create unnecessary tension and damage team relationships if done prematurely. It is important to first try to resolve conflicts at the team level before involving higher authorities.
Resposta correta

*Facilitate private discussions with both parties to understand the root cause, then conduct a structured conflict resolution meeting to align goals and update the integration plan collaboratively
Explicação
Facilitating private discussions with both parties to understand the root cause of the conflict and then conducting a structured conflict resolution meeting is the most effective first step. This approach allows the project manager to address the issues directly, align goals, and update the integration plan collaboratively. It promotes open communication, fosters understanding, and helps resolve conflicts in a constructive manner.

187 In an electric vehicle development project within the automobile industry, a key team member responsible for battery integration resigns unexpectedly. What should the project manager do first?

Immediately recruit a new team member from outside the organization
Explicação
Immediately recruiting a new team member from outside the organization may not be the best course of action as it can take time to find a suitable replacement. It is important to assess the situation and understand the impact before making any hasty decisions.

Pause the entire project until a replacement is found
Explicação
Pausing the entire project until a replacement is found can lead to delays and potentially impact project timelines. It is important to assess the situation and identify critical tasks that need immediate attention before deciding to pause the project.

Assign the team member’s tasks to the rest of the team without further analysis
Explicação
Assigning the team member's tasks to the rest of the team without further analysis may overload the existing team members and lead to inefficiencies. It is important to first assess the impact on project deliverables and identify critical tasks before redistributing responsibilities.
Resposta correta

*Assess the impact on project deliverables, identify critical tasks, and initiate knowledge transfer
Explicação
Assessing the impact on project deliverables, identifying critical tasks, and initiating knowledge transfer is the most appropriate first step for the project manager. This allows for a structured approach to addressing the sudden loss of a key team member and ensures that project progress is not severely impacted.

188 An audit firm is implementing Robotic Process Automation (RPA) to automate repetitive audit tasks like data extraction, report generation, and reconciliations. A new team member joins the implementation team but comes from a traditional audit background and has limited exposure to Agile methodology used in the project. During sprint planning and backlog refinement sessions, the team member struggles to understand how to frame automation tasks as user stories and seems confused by Agile roles and responsibilities. What should the project manager do?
Resposta correta

*Provide Agile coaching with audit-relevant examples, assign a mentor, and promote a learning-friendly environment
Explicação

Providing Agile training and mentorship is the most effective way to support a team member who is struggling with Agile principles. This option supports the team member with relevant context, mentorship, and inclusive learning—ensuring they ramp up effectively without disrupting the team’s Agile process.

Exclude the team member from Agile planning until they receive formal training
Explicação

Excluding the team member can lead to disengagement, lower morale, and missed learning opportunities. Agile encourages collaboration and learning by doing. Waiting for formal training could delay the team member’s integration and reduce productivity in the short term

Shift the project to a traditional waterfall approach to accommodate the team member
Explicação

Changing the entire project methodology to suit one person is inefficient and disrupts the team’s rhythm. RPA projects benefit from Agile’s iterative delivery, and switching to waterfall could reduce flexibility, especially when adapting bots to evolving audit requirements

Ask the team member to learn Agile concepts independently outside of work hours
Explicação

While self-learning is valuable, expecting it to happen outside of work without support can feel isolating and unfair. It’s the project manager’s responsibility to ensure proper onboarding and provide support within the work environment

189 During a banking project to launch a new mobile app feature, a team member from the IT department feels their suggestions to improve the user interface are being overlooked in meetings. What should the project manager do to address this concern and ensure all team members feel heard and valued?
Resposta correta

*Acknowledge the concern, encourage open communication, and implement a transparent idea review process
Explicação
Encouraging open discussion and ensuring inclusivity in meetings is crucial for creating a collaborative and respectful team environment. This approach allows all team members, including the IT department member, to voice their suggestions and concerns, leading to a more inclusive decision-making process.

Reassign the team member to another task to avoid conflict
Explicação
Reassigning the team member to another task to avoid conflict may not address the underlying issue of feeling overlooked. It is important to address the concerns directly and promote open communication rather than avoiding potential conflicts.

Ignore the concern to maintain focus on deadlines
Explicação
Ignoring the team member's concern about feeling overlooked in meetings can lead to decreased morale and motivation within the team. It is essential for the project manager to address these concerns and ensure all team members feel valued and heard in the project.

Ask them to document their concerns formally
Explicação
Asking the team member to document their concerns formally may be a step in the right direction, but it is equally important for the project manager to actively listen and address these concerns in a timely manner. Encouraging open dialogue and inclusivity in team meetings can help address the issue more effectively.

190 You are managing a project to set up a new coconut oil production line. One of the technicians responsible for equipment calibration and quality checks has been struggling to complete tasks on time, causing delays in the production schedule. The delays are beginning to affect downstream activities like packaging and dispatch. What should the project manager do to address this issue effectively?
Resposta correta

*Invite the technician for a discussion, provide mentorship and support
Explicação
Providing mentorship and support to the struggling team member can help address any underlying issues causing the delay in completing tasks. It shows empathy and helps the team member improve their performance, ultimately benefiting the project.

Escalate to the functional manager
Explicação

Escalating immediately may damage morale and should be a last resort after direct communication fails. It’s also premature without understanding the cause.

Send a formal warning email to the technician to create a sense of urgency
Explicação

Sending a formal warning without discussion can come across as punitive and demotivating, especially if the root cause is unknown. It also doesn't promote team cohesion

Confront the technician during the daily team meeting to highlight the delays publicly
Explicação

Publicly confronting the technician is unprofessional and could lead to embarrassment, resentment, and lower team morale. Conflict should be addressed privately and respectfully first.
